# Semester Project: Module 2

## Deliverables  **SUBMIT ONLY ONE TIME FOR EACH TEAM**
1. Design Document
2. "Hello World version of your project (Prove the Tech end to end)" **Some groups may have short delays due to the server setup not being complete by me right now, but most groups have API and Frontend work that can be completed without a deployment environment at this stage** 
3. Updates to Requirements as needed, based on my feedback. 
4. Refer to Module 5 for Criteria for Design Documents. Consider your goals, scope, and the central importance of clear communication in plain english

## Server Resources 
4. You will each have an Augur Database at your disposal, and installed for you in your VM. It will have data from a set of 92 Scientific Open Source Software Projects. There are three repositories you can use in different combinations to address the requirements for your project. 
    - https://github.com/chaoss/augur (required)
    - https://github.com/chaoss/augur-community-reports 
    - https://github.com/chaoss/augur-spdx 
5. There are related projects that you may consider incorporating into Augur as well. These include: 
    - https://deps.cloud/ -- They need a PyPi dependency collector at the moment
    - https://github.com/indeedeng/Mariner-Issue-Collector - Here, you could take a list of GitHub repositories from an Augur instance and gather information on issues recently opened.
